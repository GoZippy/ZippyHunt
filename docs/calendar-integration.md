# Calendar Integration – ZippyHunt

Want your community events to automatically become side quests in ZippyQuest? Use our calendar integration system to sync public event feeds into quest generation.

---

## 🗓️ Supported Formats

- `.ics` (iCalendar)
- Google Calendar public feeds
- City-managed event APIs (JSON or RSS)
- CSV uploads (manual)

---

## 🧩 How It Works

1. Submit your calendar feed via the admin panel (or open an issue)
2. Events are parsed and geo-tagged
3. ZippyQuest’s AI suggests themed quests, rewards, or badges
4. Moderators approve quests, or AI automatically deploys basic ones

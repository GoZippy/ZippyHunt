# Check-In Tools – ZippyHunt

This guide covers how to implement real-world check-in systems during ZippyHunt events or ZippyQuest portal visits using QR codes, GPS proximity, and manual validation options.

## ✅ Check-In Methods

### 🧾 QR Code Check-Ins
- Generate a unique QR code per quest location
- Players scan it in-app to mark completion
- Fast, low-cost, no GPS required

**How to use:**
1. Visit [QR Generator Tool](#) (coming soon)
2. Print or display QR at your location
3. Tie the QR to a quest in your admin dashboard

### 📍 GPS Proximity
- Ideal for outdoor, publicly visible locations
- App checks if user is within a small radius
- Automatically registers upon arrival

**Requirements:**
- Location services enabled
- Good GPS visibility (avoid large buildings)

### 📸 Photo Check-In (Social Proof)
- Optional quests ask users to take a selfie or object photo
- Great for social media sharing and engagement
- Manual verification or AI moderation

## 🛡️ Anti-Cheat Notes

- QR codes can be randomized or time-sensitive
- Use optional staff check marks at major events
- GPS precision is adjustable by quest type

- Track live check-ins and completion rates
- Export CSVs for analysis

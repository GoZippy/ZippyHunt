# Quest Proposal Review Process – ZippyHunt

This document outlines how we review user-submitted quests from the ZippyQuest Forge system or community voting portal.

## 🔄 Submission Flow

1. User submits a quest via the app or GitHub
2. Quest enters the **review queue**
3. Team member or regional moderator is assigned
4. Decision: Approve, Reject, or Flag for AI refinement
5. Approved quests are deployed or queued for an event
